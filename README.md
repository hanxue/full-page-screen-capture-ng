Full Page Screen Capture NG
===========================
This is a fork of the [Full Page Screen Capture](https://github.com/mrcoles/full-page-screen-capture-chrome-extension) project. The source code for the upstream project has not been updated since 1.0.1 and there are major differences between the Chrome Webstore extension and the source code.

Full Page Screen Capture
========================

A simple Google Chrome extension that takes a screen capture of a full web page. Every extension I tried couldn’t do this on Chrome 22 on Mac OSX Lion. So, I built this one to reliably do it. (Not tested, yet, on any other configurations.)

### To Install

For development:

1. Clone this repo
2. Open up Chrome and go to the extensions page (Window → Extensions)
3. Enable developer mode (if it’s not already)
4. Click on “Load unpacked extension…”
5. Select the folder for this app

From the webstore:

This fork is not yet available on Chrome Webstore. You can install the upstream extension below.

Find the [Full Page Screen Capture App](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/full-page-screen-capture/fdpohaocaechififmbbbbbknoalclacl) in the Chrome Webstore and click install. (NOTE: the webstore version is now running on a private branch of this repo and will have more updates.)
